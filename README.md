# Symmetry Based Representation Learning through Homomorphism AutoEncoders
---
Homomorphism AutoEncoder HAE is a model trained on observed transitions $(o_t, g_t, o_{t+1})$ to jointly learn a group representation of the observed actions $g_t$ and a representation of the observations $o$.

Main scripts are provided in `./displacementae/homomorphism/`.

Best run commands are provided in the `./displacementae/homomorphism/README.rst`.

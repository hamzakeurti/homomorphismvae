def action_to_id(a):

    Converts an action vector in the form of a displacement to an action id.

    Args:
        a (ndarray): a 2D array of actions with type `int` in the form of a 
                        batch of displacement of properties 
                        (\generating factors).
                        Expects values to be in :math:`-1,0,1` with only one 
                        active.
    
    Returns:
        ndarray: a 1D array of type `int`.

    TODO:
        implement in more general cases where action is not necessarily sparse.
